                  <h4>
                    Our Milky Way is one example of a broad class of galaxies
                    defined by the presence of spiral arms. These galaxies
                    resemble giant rotating pinwheels with a pancake-like disk
                    of stars and a central bulge or tight concentration of
                    stars.

            <h2>Elliptical Galaxies</h2>
            <h4>
              Unlike spirals, elliptical galaxies usually contain little gas and
              dust and show very little organization or structure. The stars
              orbit around the core in random directions and are generally older
              than those in spiral galaxies since little of the gas needed to
              form new stars remains. Scientists think elliptical galaxies
              originate from collisions and mergers with spirals.

            <h2>Lenticular Galaxies</h2>
            <h4>
              Lenticular galaxies are a kind of cross between spirals and
              ellipticals. They have the central bulge and disk common to spiral
              galaxies but no arms. But like ellipticals, lenticular galaxies
              have older stellar populations and little ongoing star formation.

            <h2>Irregular Galaxies</h2>
            <h4>
              Irregular galaxies have unusual shapes, like toothpicks, rings, or
              even little groupings of stars. They range from dwarf irregular
              galaxies with 100 million times the Sun’s mass to large ones
              weighing 10 billion solar masses.

            <h2>Active Galaxies</h2>
            <h4>
              Around 10% of known galaxies are active, which means their centers
              appear more than 100 times brighter than the combined light of
              their stars. They can be spiral, elliptical, or irregular. The
              Milky Way is not currently an active galaxy, although it likely
              experienced a burst of activity in the past few million years.

            <h2>Seyfert Galaxies</h2>
            <h4>
              Seyfert galaxies, first identified in 1943 by American astronomer
              Carl Seyfert, are the most common active galaxies and also exhibit
              the lowest energies. All Seyferts look like normal galaxies in
              visible light, but they emit considerable infrared radiation. When
              observed in the infrared, some reveal bright emission from the
              donut-shaped torus. Some also emit X-rays. Seyfert galaxies tend
              to have lower radio luminosities, although some produce radio
              jets.

            <h2>Quasars</h2>
            <h4>
              Quasars are the most luminous type of active galaxy. They emit
              light across the electromagnetic spectrum, produce powerful
              particle jets, and can radiate thousands of times the energy
              emitted by a galaxy like the Milky Way. The nearest quasar, called
              Markarian 231, is located some 600 million light-years away, but
              we see many more quasars the farther we look.

            <h2>Blazars</h2>
            <h4>
              Blazars produce light across the electromagnetic spectrum. Their
              powerful jets point almost directly at Earth, so they appear
              brighter than other active galaxies. Observatories on Earth can
              sometimes detect high-energy particles – like neutrinos – produced
              within the jets and trace them back to their home galaxy. This
              information gives scientists a glimpse into the environment around
              the blazar’s supermassive black hole

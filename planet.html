                <h3>Overview</h3>

                <p>The smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun, Mercury is only slightly larger than
                    Earth's Moon. From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it
                    does when viewed from Earth, and the sunlight would be as much as seven times brighter. Despite its
                    proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system - that title belongs to
                    nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere.

                    Because of Mercury's elliptical - egg-shaped - orbit, and sluggish rotation, the Sun appears to rise
                    briefly, set, and rise again from some parts of the planet's surface. The same thing happens in
                    reverse at sunset.</p>

                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is Earth's closest planetary neighbor. It's one of the
                    four inner, terrestrial (or rocky) planets, and it's often called Earth's twin because it's similar
                    in size and density. These are not identical twins, however - there are radical differences between
                    the two worlds. Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide and it's perpetually
                    shrouded in thick, yellowish clouds of sulfuric acid that trap heat, causing a runaway greenhouse
                    effect.</p>

                <p>Our home planet is the third planet from the Sun, and the only place we know of so far that's
                    inhabited by living things. While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is
                    the only world in our solar system with liquid water on the surface. Just slightly larger than
                    nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of the four planets closest to the Sun, all of which are made of
                    rock and metal.

                    Earth is the only planet in the Solar System whose English name does not come from Greek or Roman
                    mythology. The name was taken from Old English and Germanic. It simply means "the ground." There
                    are, of course, many names for our planet in the thousands of languages spoken by the people of the
                    third planet from the Sun.</p>

                <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun - a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin atmosphere.
                    Mars is also a dynamic planet with seasons, polar ice caps, canyons, extinct volcanoes, and evidence
                    that it was even more active in the past.ars is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system,
                    and it's the only planet where we've sent rovers to roam the alien landscape.

                    NASA currently has two rovers (Curiosity and Perseverance), one lander (InSight), and one helicopter
                    (Ingenuity) exploring the surface of Mars.</p>

                <p>Jupiter has a long history of surprising scientists - all the way back to 1610 when Galileo Galilei
                    found the first moons beyond Earth. That discovery changed the way we see the universe.Fifth in line
                    from the Sun, Jupiter is, by far, the largest planet in the solar system - more than twice as

                <p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest planet in our solar system.Adorned
                    with thousands of beautiful ringlets, Saturn is unique among the planets. It is not the only planet
                    to have rings -made of chunks of ice and rock - but none are as spectacular or as complicated as
                    Saturn's.

                    Like fellow gas giant Jupiter, Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium.</p>

                <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun, and has the third-largest diameter in our solar system. It
                    was the first planet found with the aid of a telescope, Uranus was discovered in 1781 by astronomer
                    William Herschel, although he originally thought it was either a comet or a star.It was two years
                    later that the object was universally accepted as a new planet, in part because of observations by
                    astronomer Johann Elert Bode. Herschel tried unsuccessfully to name his discovery Georgium Sidus
                    after King George III. Instead, the scientific community accepted Bode's suggestion to name it
                    Uranus, the Greek god of the sky, as suggested by Bode.</p>

                <p>Dark, cold, and whipped by supersonic winds, ice giant Neptune is the eighth and most distant planet
                    in our solar system.ore than 30 times as far from the Sun as Earth, Neptune is the only planet in
                    our solar system not visible to the naked eye and the first predicted by mathematics before its
                    discovery. In 2011 Neptune completed its first 165-year orbit since its discovery in 1846.

                    NASA's Voyager 2 is the only spacecraft to have visited Neptune up close. It flew past in 1989 on
                    its way out of the solar system.</p>

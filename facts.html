                <h3>Fact Number One:</h3>
                <p><span> You can't stand on Uranus!!</span>.That's because Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune
                    don't
                    have solid surfaces - they have a rocky core, but are mainly big balls of hydrogen and helium.

                <p> <span> The whole of Mars is as cold as the South Pole!!</span> If you’re travelling to Mars
                    anytime
                    soon, be sure to bring your big coat. Its average temperature is roughly -60°C, the same as the
                    South Pole (minus the penguins).

                <h3>Fact Number Three:</h3>
                <p><span>Saturn's rings are 90% water!!</span> Saturn is home to the Solar System’s most epic ice
                    rink.
                    Being so far from the Sun, the water in its rings is frozen into ice.</p>

                <p> <span>Jupiter's largest moon has a salty ocean!!</span> Forget holidays in the Mediterranean. If
                    you
                    want vast ocean views, Jupiter's biggest moon Ganymede is the place to be. The moon is larger
                    than
                    Mercury and would be classed as a planet if it were orbiting the Sun rather than Jupiter.</p>

                <h3>Fact Number Five:</h3>
                <p><span>The Solar System is roughly 4.5 billion years old!!</span> The Solar System is ancient. To
                    put
                    it into perspective, if the age of the Solar System were a year, humans would appear on Earth
                    just
                    before the countdown on New Year's Eve.</p>

                <h3>Fact Number Six:</h3>
                <p><span>MEET ME IN THE ORION ARM!!</span> Our solar system orbits the center of the Milky Way
                    galaxy at about 515,000 mph (828,000 kph). We're in one of the galaxys four spiral arms.</p>

                <h3>Fact Number Seven:</h3>
                <p><span>Mercury takes roughly three Earth months to orbit the Sun!!</span> In three months you
                    could write a book, pass your driving test or learn basic guitar. It's also the amount of time
                    it takes Mercury to travel around the Sun. It's the shortest orbit in the Solar System, because
                    Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun.</p>

                <h3>Fact Number Eight:</h3>
                <p><span>It would take 100 times longer to travel around the Sun than the Earth!!</span> Long haul
                    flights to the other side of the world can be gruelling, but it's nothing compared to how long
                    it would take to fly round the Sun. To go on this trip of a lifetime, you'd have to prepare
                    yourself for a journey of 206 days.

                <h3>Fact Number Nine:</h3>
                <p><span>A day is longer than a year on Venus!!</span> This one might sound completely out there,
                    but bear with us. A day is how long it takes a planet to rotate fully, and a year is how long it
                    takes a planet to orbit the Sun. Venus is one of only two planets that rotates clockwise, and it
                    spins much slower than others in the solar system.</p>

                <p><span>Pluto isn't the only dwarf planet in our Solar System!! we have six.</span> The first time
                    you may have heard the term 'dwarf planet'was when Pluto got demoted to one in 2006 (RIP).
                    However, we actually have six in our Solar System. Pluto, Ceres, Makemake, Haumea, and Eris were
                    the only five that we knew about up until very recently..</p>

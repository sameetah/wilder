          <h2>Spiral Galaxies</h2>
          <h4>
            Our Milky Way is one example of a broad class of galaxies defined
            by the presence of spiral arms. These galaxies resemble giant
            rotating pinwheels with a pancake-like disk of stars and a central
            bulge or tight concentration of stars.

          <h2>Elliptical Galaxies</h2>
          <h4>
            Unlike spirals, elliptical galaxies usually contain little gas and
            dust and show very little organization or structure. The stars
            orbit around the core in random directions and are generally older
            than those in spiral galaxies since little of the gas needed to
            form new stars remains. Scientists think elliptical galaxies
            originate from collisions and mergers with spirals.

          <h2>Lenticular Galaxies</h2>
          <h4>
            Lenticular galaxies are a kind of cross between spirals and
            ellipticals. They have the central bulge and disk common to spiral
            galaxies but no arms. But like ellipticals, lenticular galaxies
            have older stellar populations and little ongoing star formation.

          <h2>Irregular Galaxies</h2>
          <h4>
            Irregular galaxies have unusual shapes, like toothpicks, rings, or
            even little groupings of stars. They range from dwarf irregular
            galaxies with 100 million times the Sun’s mass to large ones
            weighing 10 billion solar masses.

          <h2>Active Galaxies</h2>
          <h4>
            Around 10% of known galaxies are active, which means their centers
            appear more than 100 times brighter than the combined light of
            their stars. They can be spiral, elliptical, or irregular. The
            Milky Way is not currently an active galaxy, although it likely
            experienced a burst of activity in the past few million years.

          <h2>Seyfert Galaxies</h2>
          <h4>
            Seyfert galaxies, first identified in 1943 by American astronomer
            Carl Seyfert, are the most common active galaxies and also exhibit
            the lowest energies. All Seyferts look like normal galaxies in
            visible light, but they emit considerable infrared radiation. When
            observed in the infrared, some reveal bright emission from the
            donut-shaped torus. Some also emit X-rays. Seyfert galaxies tend
            to have lower radio luminosities, although some produce radio
            jets.

          <h2>Quasars</h2>
          <h4>
            Quasars are the most luminous type of active galaxy. They emit
            light across the electromagnetic spectrum, produce powerful
            particle jets, and can radiate thousands of times the energy
            emitted by a galaxy like the Milky Way. The nearest quasar, called
            Markarian 231, is located some 600 million light-years away, but
            we see many more quasars the farther we look.

          <h2>Blazars</h2>
          <h4>
            Blazars produce light across the electromagnetic spectrum. Their
            powerful jets point almost directly at Earth, so they appear
            brighter than other active galaxies. Observatories on Earth can
            sometimes detect high-energy particles – like neutrinos – produced
            within the jets and trace them back to their home galaxy. This
            information gives scientists a glimpse into the environment around
            the blazar’s supermassive black hole
